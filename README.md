# Presentation of the project

During this project, I wanted to test my Flutter skills with something that would show how I learned from the course I took. Through this project I gained a lot of knowledge and skills to take care of problems when coding applications like this one. I used the **Openweather API** and the [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/132683011/Weather-forecast-app?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cweather+app) project on behance. This is how it looks like.

### 1. Design
Cause of my lack of ability in design interfaces I've decided to use someone else ideas to build a project by code. This is not the best thing to do but for my first project in a flutter, I think it is a good start. In my future apps, I would like to go deeper into designing my stuff and implementing it in a flutter. I choose this kind of design because I thought it was not hard but on the other side not easy. I learned a lot of widgets and functions which I will use in my future projects.

### 2. Clean code
In projects like this, the code could be long so I decided to split it into smaller parts and put it in many files. Thanks to that solution it was easy for me to navigate through my whole app, I can say this technique save me a lot of time instead of scrolling and searching for the line I wanted to edit, I used this time for more productive things.

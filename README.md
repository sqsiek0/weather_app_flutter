# Presentation of the project

During this project, I wanted to test my Flutter skills with something that would demonstrate what I had learned from the course I took. Through this project, I gained a lot of knowledge and skills for resolving problems when coding applications like this one. I used the **OpenWeather API** and a [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/132683011/Weather-forecast-app?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cweather+app) project from Behance. This is what it looks like:

### 1. Design
Due to my lack of ability to design interfaces, I decided to use someone else's ideas to build the project by code. This is not the best approach, but for my first project in Flutter, I think it is a good start. In my future apps, I would like to delve deeper into designing my own interfaces and implementing them in Flutter. I chose this particular design because I thought it was not too difficult but also not too easy. I learned a lot of widgets and functions that I will use in my future projects.

### 2. Clean code
Due to my lack of ability to design interfaces, I decided to use someone else's ideas to build the project by code. This is not the best approach, but for my first project in Flutter, I think it is a good start. In my future apps, I would like to delve deeper into designing my own interfaces and implementing them in Flutter.

# Presentation of the project

In doing this project, I wanted to test my Flutter skills with something that would show how I learned from the course I took. Through this project I gained a lot of knowledge and skills to take care of problems when coding applications like this one. I used the `Openweather API` and the [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/132683011/Weather-forecast-app?tracking_source=search_projects%7Cweather+app) project. This is what it looked like.
